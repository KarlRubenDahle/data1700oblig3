### Description
This is a web-app for ordering cinema-tickets.
It lets a user choose a film, a number of tickets,
register a name, family name, phone number and email.
This is stored in an h2-database.
The user can view alfabetized registered tickets, and delete individual tickets.
"Kj√∏p billetter"-button does not immediately update with the newest ticket,
please let me know how to fix this if it's easy.
